It ensures a clean state by deleting all sessions at the end of each test using the @After annotated tearDown method. The tearDown method fetches all existing sessions using a GET request and deletes them one by one via DELETE requests, ensuring no leftover data impacts subsequent tests.",

        "reasoning": "The test class fits the 'Create via API Calls (Fixture-based API Manipulation)' pattern because it sets up and tears down test data using API calls within the test class. The @Before method initializes the TestRestTemplate and the @After method ensures all data created during a test is deleted. The application context is reused across tests, and there is no application restart, which aligns perfectly with Pattern 3.",
